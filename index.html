<!-- Bio -->
<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>
My name is David Allen and I am a third-year computer science student<br>
from Charlotte, NC here at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical<br>
State University. I chose computer science as my major because<br>
programming piqued my interest back in middle school and that carried<br>
into high school when it came time to choose my major.<br>
<br>
Professionally, becoming a great programmer is a goal of mine so I can<br>
use my skills to help people live fulfilling lives and to make the world<br>
a better place for future generations.<br>
<br>
Some hobbies of mine include watching movies and shows, reading,<br>
writing, hanging out with people, and traveling. Below is actually a<br>
picture I took of the Appalachians while on a trip to Boone, NC.<br>
