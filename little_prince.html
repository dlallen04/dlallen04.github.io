<!-- Excerpt from "The Little Prince" -->
As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="underline"> I felt deeply
moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was
carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even,
that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the
moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed
eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
said to myself: <span class="red-and-bold">"What I see here is nothing but a
shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span><br>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspision of a
half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="red-and-bold">"What moves me
so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
that shines through his whole being like the flame
of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt<br>
him to be more fragile still. <span class="underline">I felt the need of
protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
